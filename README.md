# bash-atm
Simple ATM simulation with bash


# Purpose
My niece (13) peeped into her school's librarian's PC and fell in love with what she saw. When she described it<sup>1</sup> I knew it was bash.

She was super interested in learning what _that cool guy_<sup>2</sup> was doing that day...

Said she'd really love to be cool that way<sup>3</sup>...

And, that, ladies and gentlemen, is why I created this activity book of sorts.


## Footnotes, of sort

__1__ I was really impressed by how she was able to recall the things he typed into his editor

__2__ She actually called him the coolest guy ever. Imagine that. I mean, you'll invest years imitating a child's favorite cartoon characters in order to make Raspberry PI classes fun, and next thing you know, some guy who has probably never celebrated SpongeBob's birthday displaces you so effortlessly! Cue nervous laughter.

__3__ She actually said she was going to ask him to teach her &mdash; really, we need an emoticon for nervous laughter.


### Extra Footnotes

It's all fun, really. I have mad respect for the librarian.
